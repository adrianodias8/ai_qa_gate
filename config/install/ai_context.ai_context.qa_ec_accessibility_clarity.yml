  ## Accessibility and Clarity Standards

  ### Plain Language
  - Use clear, straightforward language
  - Define technical terms on first use
  - Expand acronyms on first use (e.g., "Digital Services Act (DSA)")
  - Avoid jargon where possible; explain it where necessary

  ### Structure
  - Use logical paragraph organization
  - Lead with key information
  - Use headings to organize content
  - Keep sentences reasonably short (aim for under 25 words)

  ### Acronym Handling
  - Always expand acronyms on first use
  - Consider maintaining a glossary for recurring terms
  - Do not assume reader familiarity with EU-specific abbreviations

  ### Inclusive Language
  - Use gender-neutral language
  - Avoid assumptions about reader background
  - Be mindful of cultural and linguistic diversity

  ### Technical Content
  - Provide context for technical requirements
  - Link to additional resources for complex topics
  - Use examples to illustrate abstract concepts

  ### Good Examples
  - "The Digital Services Act (DSA) establishes rules for online platforms. The DSA requires..."
  - "Providers must implement measures to address illegal content—material that violates applicable laws."
  - "Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) are services with more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU."

  ### Bad Examples
  - "The DSA, DMA, GDPR and NIS2 create a comprehensive framework..." (undefined acronyms)
  - "Providers must ensure interoperability of ancillary services pursuant to ex ante obligations." (jargon-heavy)
  - "See Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR." (assumes legal familiarity)
