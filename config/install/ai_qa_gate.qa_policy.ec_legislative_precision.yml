  ## Legislative Communication Standards

  ### Status Indicators
  All references to EU legislation must indicate:
  - Current procedural status (proposal, trilogue, adopted, in force)
  - Applicable dates (entry into force, application dates, deadlines)
  - Relevant legal basis

  ### Terminology Requirements
  - Use official legislative titles and numbers (e.g., "Regulation (EU) 2022/2065")
  - Distinguish between Regulations (directly applicable) and Directives (require transposition)
  - Avoid absolute legal interpretations that should come from courts

  ### Claims and Obligations
  - Differentiate between:
    - What the law requires
    - What the Commission recommends
    - What implementation guidance suggests
  - Avoid stating legal consequences without proper caveats
  - Do not make definitive statements about legal interpretation

  ### Risk Language
  Avoid:
  - Guarantees about legal outcomes
  - Absolute statements about compliance
  - Predictions about enforcement actions

  GOOD: "The Directive must be transposed into national law by Member States by [date]."
  GOOD: "Depending on interpretation, platforms may need to implement additional measures."

examples_bad: |
  BAD: "The law ensures platforms will be held accountable." (interpretation, not fact)
  BAD: "Companies must comply or face huge fines." (oversimplified threat)
  BAD: "This regulation covers all online services." (too absolute without specifying scope)
