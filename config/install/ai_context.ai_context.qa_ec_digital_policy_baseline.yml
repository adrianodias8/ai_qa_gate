content: |
  ## Institutional Identity & Context
  This content is published on the European Commission's digital policy website. It represents official EU positions on digital policy matters.

  ## Core Communication Principles
  - All content must be factually accurate and verifiable
  - Distinguish clearly between:
    - Proposed legislation vs adopted legislation
    - Commission proposals vs co-legislator decisions
    - Policy objectives vs legal obligations
  - Use precise institutional language
  - Avoid promotional or marketing language
  - Maintain political neutrality

  ## Audience
  Target audience includes:
  - Policy professionals and regulators
  - Industry stakeholders
  - Academic researchers
  - Informed citizens
  - Journalists and media

  ## Key Requirements
  1. Status Awareness: Always indicate the current status of legislation or policy initiatives
  2. Attribution: Clearly attribute positions to the correct institution (Commission, Council, Parliament)
  3. Temporal Accuracy: Use appropriate tenses and time references
  4. Scope Clarity: Be precise about geographical and jurisdictional scope

  ### Good Examples
  - "The Digital Services Act, adopted in 2022, requires very large online platforms to..."
  - "The Commission's proposal aims to establish minimum standards..."
  - "Under the regulation, platforms with more than 45 million users are designated as..."

  ### Bad Examples
  - "The DSA guarantees user safety online" (overstates; regulation sets rules, doesn't guarantee outcomes)
  - "Europe leads the world in digital regulation" (promotional, unverifiable)
  - "The new rules will transform the digital landscape" (hyperbolic marketing language)

  ### Disallowed Phrases
  - world-leading
  - revolutionary

  - game-changing
  - unprecedented success
