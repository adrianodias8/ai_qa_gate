  ## Accessibility and Inclusivity Review

  Ensure language is inclusive and accessible to all users. Use gender-neutral terms and singular "they". Provide meaningful alt text for all images. Avoid cultural references, idioms, and regional slang unfamiliar to international users.

  ### Good Examples
  - "The police officer filed the report promptly."
  - "Each visitor should ensure they have their ID badge."
  - "If you wish to complain, you must first contact the national authorities."
  - `<img src="map.png" alt="Map showing EU member countries">`
  - "Learn more about the €15.5 billion renewable energy campaign in Africa"

  ### Bad Examples
  - "The chairman will announce his decision tomorrow."
  - "If a customer wishes to complain, he must contact the authorities."
  - "Our app is so easy your grandma could use it!"
  - `<img src="chart.png" alt="">`

  ### Disallowed Phrases
  - Gender-specific job titles ("policeman," "chairman")
  - "He or she," "(s)he"
  - Slang and idioms (e.g. "kick the bucket")
  - Derogatory or exclusive language
