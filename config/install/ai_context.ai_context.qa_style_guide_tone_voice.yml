  ## Tone and Voice Review

  Ensure all content is conversational, reader-friendly, and written in active voice. Use plain language, contractions where appropriate, and speak directly to the reader ("you"). Avoid administrative or bureaucratic tone.

  ### Good Examples
  - "You can submit a complaint online, and we'll guide you through each step."
  - "We're updating our guidelines to help you find information faster."
  - "The tool is easy to use – just click 'Start' and follow the prompts."

  ### Bad Examples
  - "Complaints can be submitted to the Commission in writing."
  - "It is often the case that users experience difficulties during registration."
  - "The first thing to keep in mind is that the procedure must hereby be completed in full."

  ### Disallowed Phrases
  - "It is often the case that..."
  - "The first thing to keep in mind is that..."
  - "Please be aware that..."
  - "Remember that..."
  - Bureaucratic terms like "hereby," "thereof"
  - Third-person references like "the user," "he/she"
